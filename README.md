# Iris Flowers Classification
The main objective of this project is to create and evaluate machine learning models for classifying Iris flowers into species such as Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The project showcases the typical workflow of a machine learning project, including data loading, preprocessing, model selection, training, evaluation, and interpretation.

## About the Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the well-known Iris dataset, which contains measurements of iris flowers' sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. These measurements are used as features to predict the species of the iris flowers.

## Results
The models are trained and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and loss. Visualizations of data distributions are provided to aid in understanding the results.
